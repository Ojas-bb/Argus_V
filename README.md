# Argus_V

This repository contains the initial scaffolding for **Argus_V**.

The shared, cross-cutting utilities live under `argus_v.oracle_core` (configuration, structured logging, schema helpers, and anonymization primitives).

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```

See `README.Docs/Configuration.md` and `README.Docs/Logging.md` for usage examples and sample config layouts.
